# Predicting Critical Temperature of Superconducting Materials

The critical temperature of a superconductor refers to the temperature below which materials become superconductors. Superconductors have astounding applications in the modern era be it Quantum Computers or Superfast trains. The major hurdle to the process is the temperature at which superconductors exist. Superconducting properties are more pronounced at very low temperatures. However recent research has shown some materials to have T_c of more than 10K. These are referred to as high-temperature superconductors. To determine such materials sophisticated laboratories with highly skilled personnel are required to operate and find the critical temperatures. This also requires an investment of a hefty sum for the research.

In this project, I adopt a somewhat easy approach where I train a ML model to detect the critical temperature of materials and detect which alloys should be more preferred for these purposes. I have added the code files and the datasets (thanks to SuperCon database for that!). I can be contacted for the full report of the same.
